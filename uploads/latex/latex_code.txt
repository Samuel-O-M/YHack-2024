This supplementary file complements the slideshow for the NYC Quantum Hackathon and is in no way emanating the knowledge presented in those of a paper. We began by using key papers to define and setup the initial problem and implement our own programs to verify and test against reigning classical models. This supplemental resource explores the strengths and weaknesses of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), with a focus on its applicability to real-world financial scenarios \cite{Cerezo2021}. Additionally, it discusses the computational complexity, convergence rates, and potential advantages these quantum algorithms offer over classical methods in optimizing asset allocation and risk management. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the performance of each algorithm on benchmark portfolio optimization problems, highlighting their scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets. The analysis aims to identify the specific conditions under which each algorithm excels, offering insights into their practical implementation within financial institutions.

Portfolio optimization, rooted in the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) as introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952 \cite{Markowitz1952}, seeks to maximize expected returns while minimizing risk through the strategic allocation of assets. This process typically involves the use of a covariance matrix to analyze the relationships between various assets, alongside metrics such as the Sharpe ratio to evaluate performance \cite{Sharpe1964}. However, the complexity of these optimization problems often categorizes them as NP-hard, presenting significant challenges in computational feasibility \cite{Boyd2004}. Traditional methods, including Monte Carlo simulations and maximum diversification techniques, struggle to efficiently navigate the vast solution space inherent in large portfolios.

In recent years, advancements in quantum computing have opened new avenues for tackling these complex optimization problems \cite{Moll2018}. Notable contributions from organizations such as IBM and D-Wave have demonstrated the potential of quantum algorithms to outperform classical approaches \cite{Hodson2019}. Quantum algorithms, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) \cite{Peruzzo2014, McClean2016}, offer unique advantages in optimizing asset allocation and risk management by leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement.

These techniques can leverage entanglement to perform calculations, significantly reducing the time required to identify optimal strategies in dynamic market conditions \cite{Cerezo2021}. As the financial industry continues to embrace these innovations, we can expect a paradigm shift in how investment strategies are developed and executed, ultimately leading to more robust and resilient portfolios. Thus, it makes sense that the motivation behind this challenge lies in understanding the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize traditional financial models and enhance decision-making processes through an analysis of time and space complexity as well as scalability.
\section{Theory}
\subsection{Variational Quantum Algorithm Overview}

To intuitively understand the algorithm, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver is defined based on the 2022 paper written by Jules Tilly \cite{Tilly2022}. We will then introduce the IBM Qiskit implementation through it.

The goal of VQE is to optimize an upper bound for the lowest possible expectation value of an observable with respect to a trial wavefunction. Specifically, by presenting a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ and a trial wavefunction $\ket{\psi}$, the ground state energy associated with this Hamiltonian, denoted as $E_0$, is constrained by the inequality 
\[
E_0 \leq \frac{\bra{\psi}\hat{H}\ket{\psi}}{\bra{\psi}\psi\rangle}. 
\tag{1}
\]
Consequently, the primary aim of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is to ascertain a parameterization of $\ket{\psi}$ that minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. This expectation value serves as an upper limit for the ground state energy and, in an ideal scenario, should be indistinguishable from the true ground state energy to the desired precision level. From a mathematical perspective, our objective is to derive an approximation of the eigenvector $\ket{\psi}$ of the Hermitian operator $\hat{H}$ that corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue, $E_0$. 

To reformulate this minimization endeavor into a task amenable to execution on a quantum computer, it is imperative to begin by defining an ansatz wavefunction that can be formed into a executable circuit on a quantum device through a succession of quantum gates. Since only unitary operations or measurements can be conducted on a quantum computer, this is accomplished by employing parameterized unitary operations. 

Thus, we articulate $\ket{\psi}$ as the result of applying a generic parameterized unitary $U(\theta)$ to an initial state representing $N$ qubits, with $\theta$ representing a set of parameters that assume values within the interval $(-\pi, \pi]$. The qubit register is typically initialized as $\ket{0}^{\otimes N}$ for simplicity, although low-depth operations may be executed for alternative initial states prior to the application of the unitary. Note, we will denote $\ket{0}^{\otimes N}$ as $\ket{0}$ for simplification of the equations. Acknowledging that $\ket{\psi}$ (and similarly any $U(\theta)\ket{\psi}$) must inherently be a normalized wavefunction, we can reformulate the VQE optimization challenge as 
\[
E_{\text{VQE}} = \min_{\theta} \bra{0}U^\dagger(\theta) \hat{H} U(\theta)\ket{0}.
\tag{2}
\]
Equation (2) is commonly referred to as the cost function of the VQE optimization framework, a term derived from the realms of machine learning and optimization literature. 

We can extend this exposition by expressing the Hamiltonian in a form that is directly measurable on a quantum computer, represented as a weighted sum of spin operators. Observables that are conducive to direct measurement on a quantum device are tensor products of spin operators (Pauli operators). We may define these as Pauli strings: 
\[
\hat{P}_a \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes N},
\]
where $N$ signifies the number of qubits utilized to model the wavefunction. The Hamiltonian can be reformulated as 
\[
\hat{H} = \sum_a w_a \hat{P}_a,
\tag{3}
\]
where $w_a$ denotes a set of weights, and $P$ represents the total number of Pauli strings within the Hamiltonian. Consequently, Equation (2) transforms into 
\[
E_{\text{VQE}} = \min_{\theta} \sum_a w_a \bra{0}U^\dagger(\theta) \hat{P}_a U(\theta)\ket{0},
\tag{4}
\]
wherein the hybrid nature of the VQE becomes distinctly evident: each term 
\[
E_{P_a} = \bra{0}U^\dagger(\theta) \hat{P}_a U(\theta)\ket{0}
\]
corresponds to the expectation value of a Pauli string $\hat{P}_a$ and can be computed on a quantum device, while the summation and minimization 
\[
E_{\text{VQE}} = \min_{\theta} \sum_a w_a E_{P_a}
\]
are executed on a classical computer.
